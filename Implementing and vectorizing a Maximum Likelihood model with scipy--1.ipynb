    "# Implementing and vectorizing a Maximum Likelihood model with scipy\n",
    "\n",
    "**By: Matt Ranger**\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook walks through the process of coding, testing, estimating, and vectorizing a Maximum Likelihood (MLE) model \"from scratch\" using scipy's numerical optimization package. Not all MLE models are available in pre-cooked packages, so this skill is necessary for some research topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will only be touching a simple model here (regular probit), so as not to get bogged down in extraneous complexities. This general method of estimation, testing, and vectorization will however work for a wide range of MLE models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Probit**\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic probit model takes a binary dependent variable, $Y$, and assumes that $Pr(Y=1 | X) = \\Phi(X^T \\beta)$ where $X$ is the matrix of independent variables, $\\beta$ is the vector of parameters to estimate, and $\\Phi$ is the CDF of the standard normal distribution. We want to take the likelihood function $L=PR(\\beta|X, Y)$, and maximize it over $\\beta$ to get the most likely $\\beta$ paramaters given the data $X,Y$. We usually use the log of the likelihood function in practice, because it is simpler in both math and computation, and the maximum point is the same. The probit log likelihood is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ln L(\\beta|X,Y) = \\sum_{i=1}^n[y_i ln \\Phi(x_i'\\beta)+(1-y_i)ln(1-\\Phi(x_i'\\beta)) ]$$\n",
